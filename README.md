# Welcome to i-s-term

`i-s-term` is a terminal themed personal website created by me for me. (Liz Phillips)
The `i-s` in `i-s-term` stands for `illuminatedspace` my username on just about everything.

## Features

### Dope terminal visuals

_Don't go another day sacrificing style for functionality_

- complete with subtle x-bit terminal graphics
- terminal-esque type input with `--help` and a `manual` page
- clickable interfaces for the non-terminal inclined

### Resume Generator

_Never worry about reformatting your resume again_

- `project`, `accolade`, `school`, and `job` entry types
- assemble a new resume by tag
- add individual entries
- view the generated resume in the resume tab, or save out a PDF

## Technologies
